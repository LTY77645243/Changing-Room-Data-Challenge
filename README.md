# Changing-Room-Data-Challenge
This this the repository for Changing room summer data engineer position

1. SHEIN_Scraping.ipynb is the main notebook where I use selenium to deal with javascript files and extract information and use sqlalchemy to store rsults on postgresql. In this notebook, I only scraped a few dresses made by SHEIN. In order to scrape the whole website, I need to set up a timer and run some for loops to fetch every category and products on each page. By the way, I think SHEIN's web design is very messy, maybe we can together come up with a best solution to extract information from SHEIN.

2. unittest.ipynb is the notebook for unittesting my get_product() function.

3. unittest.py is .py file for the purpose of testing

4. SHEIN_Products.xlsx is the excel file that you can use to check some sample outputs.
